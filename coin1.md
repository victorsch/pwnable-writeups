I'm not gonna lie, I knew what I had to do for this one and was just too lazy to do it. I'm in the mood right now for some fun binary exploits, some code logic bugs, perhaps some reverse engineering, y'know?

This was a basic binary tree search challenge where you gotta filter through a lot of data with a limited number of tries. It is a GREAT challenge to become comfortable with something like pwntools.
