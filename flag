## flag

If you open the file in gdb, it acts all funky and doesn't let you debug like normal. By running something like strings on the binary (or opening it in ghidra to be extra like me, you'll notice it's been packed by UPX0

We can download upx and run `upx -d flag` to unpack it and get a normal executable which we can now debug. Let the program run and look at the memory region marked as flag to get the flag after its copied into there to get the flag.

UPX...? sounds like a delivery service :)
